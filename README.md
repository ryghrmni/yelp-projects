# yelp-projects

The projects that have been implemented with the Yelp dataset are:
1. Finding similar items: The task is to implement from scratch a detector of pairs of similar tweets, considering the text field of the dataset.
2. Recommender system: The task is to implement from scratch a system recommending businesses to users.
3. Deep Learning: The task is to train a neural network that predicts the rating of a review starting from its textual contents.
4. Clustering: The task is to implement from scratch a clustering system for reviews. You are free to choose the representation of reviews and the clustering algorithm, provided that the latter scales up with data size.
